    Text: In Alias, players form teams of two or more people. The goal of the game
      is to explain a word to another player using synonyms, antonyms, descriptions,
      and various clues. Players cross out fields on the game sheet according to
      the number of words correctly guessed. The team that reaches the finish line
      first wins the game!
